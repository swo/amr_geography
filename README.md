# Display items

1. Dynamical model
2. Use/resistance across datasets
3. Adjacent vs. not pairs

## Supplemental

- Dtypes
- Commuting

# Analyses

- Adjacency
- Adjacency with covariates
- Adjacency with LORRU
- Commuting

# Results

- Include the bit about "mixing" that's described in the "math" folder

#  Discussion

- Limitations
    - Assuming cross-sectional analysis is useful for predicting effects of perturbations
    - Pairwise analysis. Something might arise if you look at the whole network.
- Resistance might also be more similar because you're drawing from the same pop's. E.g., a hospital in Kansas City might have equal numbers of people from the two states in it!
- But we dealt with the above
- In general, though, would be nice to know where people live and where they are "reporting" their infections, which becomes especially important at small length scales! (cf Mass APCD paper)

# In the code

- Pick "EU" or "Europe" throughtout
- Finish cleaning up the db's

# Reviewer responses

See the Google doc!
