Data downloaded from [NBER](http://www.nber.org/data/seer_u.s._county_population_data.html), which got them from SEER. These are the "All States Combined", County, 19 Age Groups, 1969--.

Need the data file `uswbo19ages.csv`.

I summarize the data over year and state to get a single population number.
