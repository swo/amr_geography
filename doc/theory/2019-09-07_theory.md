Each state $i$ has some resistance level $\rho_i$ that is determined by its own particular determinants $\eta_i$ and the surrounding resistances:
$$
\eta_i = \mu + \beta_\tau \tau_i + \beta_x x_i
$$

Populations are linked by $\alpha_{ij}$:
$$
\rho_i = \alpha_{ii} \eta_i + \sum_{j \neq i} \alpha_{ij} \eta_j + \epsilon_i
$$

If $\alpha_ii = \alpha_jj$ and $\alpha_{ij} = \alpha{ji}$, then
$$
\Delta \rho = (\alpha_{11} - \alpha{12}) \Delta \eta + \sum_{i \geq 2}(\alpha_{1i} - \alpha{2i}) \eta_i + \Delta \epsilon
$$

If we assume that the sum is small, because the differences will generally cancel out(?), then
$$
\Delta \rho = \Delta \alpha \Delta \eta + \Delta \epsilon
$$

# Alternate approach

Each unit is either its own master $\rho_i = \eta_i$, or a mixture of its determinants and the surrounding ones:
$$
\rho_i = \sum_j \alpha_{ij} \eta_j
$$
The parameters $s$ says how much we do that mixing:
$$
\rho_i = (1-s) \eta_i + s \sum_j \alpha_{ij} \eta_j
  = \left[ 1 - s(1 - \alpha_{ii}) \right] \eta_i + s \sum_{j \neq i} \alpha_{ij} \eta_j
$$
